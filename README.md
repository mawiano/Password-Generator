# Password-Generator
## Description
Created the Java Script for a random password generator. The user will first have the option of choosing a password from 8-128 characters. Then they will select if they want the password to include capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or special chharcaters. Then after all of each prompt answered, they will be given a passord that includes the password length they chose, and what characters they picked to include.
